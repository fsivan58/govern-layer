 * code address_offset could be obtained by means of __builtin_tbloffset(func)

 * 
 * Where "func" is the name of the function which contains the code of 
 * the new task.
 * 
 * mem_needed must contain the nedded words (of 16 bits) for the task stack. 
 * 
 * It should be taken into consideration that, when a Task is removed 
 * from the processor by the scheduler, it is necessary to store 32 
 * 16-bit words on the stack, corresponding to the context of the 
 * running task (all dps registers). In addition, it is necessary to preserve 
 * the return addresses of the currently invoked functions and the stack frame
 * of an interrupt treatment (TMR1 or INT2). This knowledge can be used 
 * to estimate the amount of memory required for a task.
 * 
 * priority must contain the task priority. The larger the number.
 * the higher the priority. Priority must be greather than 0 
 * 
 * 
 * Returns the identifier of the new task if everything performed correctly.
 * 
 * Returns -1 if there is no free task control block. 
 * 
 * Returns -2 if declared priority is not greather than 0.

 * Returns -3 if there is no enought free memory to satisfy the required
 * quantity.
