/* This routine creates a task (process) to run on the microkernel.
 * 
 * Code_address must contain the address of the function containing 
 * the task code. More specifically:
 * 
 * code address_page could be obtained by means of __builtin_tblpage(func)
 * which actually returns the high part of the memory address of the function,
 * bits <22:16>
 * 
 * code address_offset could be obtained by means of __builtin_tbloffset(func)
 * which actually returns the low part of the memory address of the  function, 
 * bits <15:0>
 * 
 * Where "func" is the name of the function which contains the code of 
 * the new task.
 * 
 * mem_needed must contain the nedded words (of 16 bits) for the task stack. 
 * 
 * It should be taken into consideration that:
 * 
 * 1) When a Task is removed from the processor by the scheduler, 
 * it is necessary to store 32 16-bit words on the stack, corresponding 
 * to the context of the running task (all dps registers). That must be 
 * increased in two words (4 bytes) corresponding to the return address 
 * and bits 0:7 of SR register, of the interrupted task (interrupted by 
 * the timer).
 * 
 * 2) Additionally, when the scheduler is executed it also temporally consumes 
 * 7 words (14 bytes) of stack space.
 * 
 * 3) Some services of the micro-kernel consumes stack space for local data
 * (among others needs). The "mutex-lock" service is the most demanding and 
 * it needs 13 words (26 bytes).
 *
 * 4) Be careful with standard library services, because some of them could 
 * need a great amount of stack. For example, printf could need more than 
 * 170 bytes of stack.
 * 
 * priority must contain the task priority. The larger the number.
 * the higher the priority. Priority must be greather than 0 
 * 
 * 
 * Returns the identifier of the new task if everything performed correctly.
 * 
 * Returns -1 if there is no free task control block. 
 * 
 * Returns -2 if declared priority is not greather than 0.
 * 
 * Returns -3 if there is no enought free memory to satisfy the required
 * quantity.
